This repository contains sketches for learning [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/).  

* [Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists (MIT Press)](http://www.amazon.com/Processing-Programming-Handbook-Designers-Artists/dp/026202828X/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1406934187&sr=1-6&keywords=processing) is one of my most favorite programming books. The folder Processing Handbook, 2nd Edition contains ports of the example Processing code in the book converted to their openFramework equivalent.  Hopefully this helps simplify the learning process of someone familiar with Processing into the world of C++.
