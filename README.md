ofx-experiments
================

This repository contains sketches for learning [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/). 

To get started, download the latest release of openFrameworks from http://openframeworks.cc/download/

* processing_on_ofx folder has my little experiment of implementing the [Processing API](https://processing.org/reference/) inside of openFrameworks.  

   ![processing on ofx](https://github.com/JosephLaurino/ofx-experiments/blob/master/desktop.png "processing on ofx")

   I got the book [Processing Handbook, 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Processing-Programming-Handbook-Designers-Artists/dp/026202828X/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1406934187&sr=1-6&keywords=processing) as a secret santa gift and I've been meaning to learn Processing.  I also want to learn OpenFrameworks. Why not learn both? So this is my attept of implementing the Processing APIs as I encounter them in reading the Processing Handbook -- Joseph Laurino (5/22/16)

*  Processing Handbook, 2nd Edition folder contains ports of the example Processing code in the book converted to their openFramework equivalent.  Hopefully this helps simplify the learning process of someone familiar with Processing into the world of C++.

   Just clone this repository under the apps folder.  On my system it's under of_v0.9.3_osx_release/apps/ofx-experiments and the projects will compile properly since the build paths are relative.
