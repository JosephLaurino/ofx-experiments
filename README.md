ofx-experiments
================

This repository contains sketches for learning [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/). 

To get started, download the latest release of openFrameworks from http://openframeworks.cc/download/

* [Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists (MIT Press)](http://www.amazon.com/Processing-Programming-Handbook-Designers-Artists/dp/026202828X/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1406934187&sr=1-6&keywords=processing) is one of my most favorite programming books. The folder Processing Handbook, 2nd Edition contains ports of the example Processing code in the book converted to their openFramework equivalent.  Hopefully this helps simplify the learning process of someone familiar with Processing into the world of C++.

    Just clone this repository under the apps folder.  On my system it's under of_v0.9.3_osx_release/apps/ofx-experiments and the projects will compile properly since the build paths are relative.
